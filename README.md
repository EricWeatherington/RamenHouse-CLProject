Code Louisville WebDev1 Project - Mock website for restaurant Ramen House

I am currently enrolled in Code Louisville's WebDev course 1, and for completion of this course I was instructed to create a website with a mobile first approach. 

For my first project in WebDev, I decided to create a website for a local restaurant that I have close relations with.  I thought doing so would help me with my motivation and ultimately be more fun.  Easy to say that I did have a lot of fun with this one!

The requirements for this project are to be visual appealing, be posted to github, and include a few of the features learned over the past few months with Code Louisville.  

The features that I decided to include are:

        - Responsive Menu with CSS/Javascript
        - Hover Transitions within my Navbar
        - Hide/Show Div for my hamburger menu in Mobile view
        - Run PageSpeed Insights from google.com get a score of 60 or better


Also this restaurant is really good, so check that out too if you have a chance!

Thanks for checking out my project!
